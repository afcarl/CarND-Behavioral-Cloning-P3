Just Running around the track in laps seems to not really give us good val_loss
Recording strategically going along straight lines, going through corners
both ways seems to give us good validation loss.

I think it was overfitting.

Using LeNet

using shorter data set, I see that we have 10 epochs, 1292 image sets, val_los 108

Train with more curves and straight aways but only those. For some reason
the most recent data had strong right ward bias

Trying out some more training data, did a complete lap with periodic training
flipped over images and steering angles.
